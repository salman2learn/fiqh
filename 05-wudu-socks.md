### Masah on socks

Why:

- if traveling
- if not travelling but being lazy (?) -- in contrast to tayammum (laziness is not allowed)
-

| Role **  | Masah can be done upto * | Duration Example                                             | Role Transition                                              |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Resident | 1 day and 1 night        | Wudu done at fajr. Wudu broken near zuhr. Masah can be done upto zuhr of next day. | A travelers comes home, the flexibility restricts to 1 day again. |
| Traveler | 3 days and 3 nights      |                                                              | If a resident starts a travel within 1 day, he becomes a travelers and 3-day flexibility applies. |

```
* duration counted from the time wudu breaks

** Travelers definition: (all three AND condition)
1. traveling outside of home city
2. 48 miles travel intention (driven from hadees: 3 days x based on 6 hours walk/camel movement per day)
3. staying till 15 days (after 15 days, the person become resident)
```

### Conditions:

1. Must have done wudu in the beginning and then wearing socks. 
2. Socks touching upto ankles (start of ankles; covering round bone of feet)
3. Thick enough to waterproof the feet (e.g. leather)
4. Socks should be hard enough that they can stand up to ankle height (ncc shoes???)
5. Walkable after wearing upto 3 miles (e.g. rugged leather socks)
6. damaged socks??? (invalidated via waterproofing condition anyways) -- 3 fingers visible = masah broken
   1. think of desert traveller (no water). may be damaged socks are ok.

7. clean socks

### Socks definition

1. NCC shoes???

### Steps:

1. Wipe upside of feet 1x time with at least 3 wet fingers
2. Wipe upwards from feet fingers towards start of ankle. Not compulsory to wet full sock.

### When masah breaks:

1. When wudu breaks 
2. Taking off socks, even half of the feet, even if one feet (e.g. taking socks at night during travel)
3. When the duration expires (resident: 1day1night, travelers: 3day3night)
3. Water reaches feet (e.g. standing in water for extended time would permeate water through seams)

### Plaster/Bandage (page print 63; pdf 96)

   e.g. burn on hand, upon which touch water will make it worse.

Masah eligible till: 

- there is injury is known to person (e.g. hard plaster, person cannot see healing level)
- if person finds out that injury is gone (after removing plaster), eligibility is gone
  - even if person is in namaz; redo namaz after wudu
- till wudu is valid

Remember previous cases (doctor opinion):

- new illness will occur
- existing illness will increase
- existing illness will extend duration of recovery

**If bandage or plaster can be opened:**

â€‹	Order of Actions, based on possibility: (wash > wipe > wipe surrounding)

- wash/wudu (if medically allowed to wash) 
- wipe on top of bandage (if medically allowed to wipe) 
- keep it dry, wash/wipe surrounding parts

If bandage cannot be opened:

- is it easy to open and close it, open it and do wash/wipe
- if person cannot open and close (pack), or helper is not available, do masah




#### Masah on Socks vs Bandages

|               | Masah on socks                                              | Masah on bandages |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Duration      | Duration is limited (resident:1day,1night, traveler: 3d/3n) | No duration limit |
| Pre-condition |                                                             |                   |
|               |                                                             |                   |

Tayammum and Masah are temporary replacement for Wudu.

Anything that breaks wudu, invalidates Tayammum and Masah.

e.g. if bath becomes required (hadas akbar), the person must take bath while protecting the injury (e.g. plastic cover)

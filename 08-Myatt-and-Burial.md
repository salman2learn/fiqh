### Death and Burial

12/11/2024

**Last Moments - Dying person:** 

- Recite kalma on his/her own (as the last words; and then stay quiet)
- Try to face towards qibla

**Last Moments - Folks near dying person:**

- Recite kalma shahadat (2nd) - loudly
- Recite Surah Yaseen - it helps against the pains of death.

**After Death:**

- Say: "Inna Lillah e Wa inna ileyhe rajeeoon" (We are Allah's and to Allah we shall return)
- Gently close the eyes. Bind face (chin to head) with some thin cloth. Tie the foot thumbs together.
- Cover body with sheet.
- Do not leave body on ground.
- Put some weight on stomach, so it doesn't swell.
- Do dua while doing (binding) steps:

Translation:

```
I start in the Name of Allah and religion taught by Prophet of Allah. 
O Allah - Make the task easy for this person.
Make the upcoming situations easy for this person
Make them blessed by Your Sight.
Give the person better place compared to where this person previously was.
```

**Next Steps:**

- Announce the death; so many folks can join in janazah
- Avoid recite quran majeed near the person; before qusl is done.



### Qusl (Bath)

- For people alive, it is Farz-e-kifayah. see [link](00-Shared-definitions.md)<img src="assets/08-Myatt-and-Burial/image-20241211080237498.png" alt="image-20241211080237498" style="zoom:33%;" />

**Conditions for Qusl:**

- For muslims only
- Head and at least half of the body is present
- The person was NOT shaheed. Shaheed are buried in same clothing and blood.
- NOT done for unformed unborned child. Baby must have come to live (make sound or movement) before dying
- Done for Baby born dead but body formation was complete.
- Okay to do person who did suicide

Who can do:

- Close relatives; but any other person can do too
- Men to man; Women to woman - should have knowledge of steps
- Someone can be paid to do it; but the person being paid is not getting sawab.
- Wife can do for husband, but husband cannot do for wife.
- Either Men or Women can do qusl for young boy or girl, but if they have grown to near adulthood e.g. teen, then only same gender can do qusl.
- Folks who are napak (hadas e akbar???) cannot do qusl. (see [link](06-Nijasatain.md))<img src="assets/08-Myatt-and-Burial/image-20241211081512070.png" alt="image-20241211081512070" style="zoom:67%;" /> 



#### Qusl Steps:

Items:

- Flat wood board (loban smoked??)
- Cotton roll
- Soap, water
- Bath warm water with cooked leaves of bairy (fruit) ??
- Tiled area so water can easily flow down
- Water with kafoor (?)
- Kafan cloth (? to be described later)



1. Flat wood board (on which person will be bathed). 5-7 put loban smoke?? around that board.
2. Put person on board; "try" that qibla is to the right side.
3. Cover satar (body parts to hide) with thick cloth after removing previous clothes
   1. Whatever was not permitted to view when alive; the same applies after death too.
4. Use gloves and clean just like we clean ourselves after going for #1 or #2
5. Start wudu for person:
   1. Use thick wet cotton piece to clean mouth, teeth, nose. Do not put water inside mouth, nose (even if body in state of hadas akbar)
   2. Put cotton to seal nose, ear, mouth
   3. Similar to wuzu, wash face, arms, head masah, feet x3
6. Wash head with soap
7. Tilt person towards left and use warm water (warmed with leaves) to flow from head to toe (3x)
8. Do the other side (3x)
9. Make the person sit a bit, and then press stomach to release body fluid. No need to do qusl again, if they release.
10. Now flow kafoor water from head to toe 3x on each side tilted.
11. Put kafan cloth on carrying casket, and put body on it gently. 
12. Remove cotton from nose, ear, mouth.

Notes:

- Instead of 3x, 1x washing (flowing water) is fine too
- Raining on body or drowned body is not same is bath. Qusl/wudu is still necessary
- If drowned body is brought out from water, and cleaned while bringing out with niyat of qusl, then qusl is done.
- Person giving qusl should take qusl after doing it (mustahib = preferred) - see [link](00-Shared-definitions.md) <img src="assets/08-Myatt-and-Burial/image-20241211084112262.png" alt="image-20241211084112262" style="zoom:50%;" /> 



#### Kafan

- Putting kafan is Farz-e-kifaya (same as qusl; not compulsary; but some must do it)
- Kafan is arranged by near relatives; but others can give it too.
  - If someone was taking care of the person (while dead person was incapable of purchasing kafan), the same caretaker should arrange for kafan
  - If there is no one, then kafan should be arrange from bayt ul maal (muslim reserves)
  - If there is not much in bayt ul maal, then muslim with money should arrange the kafan. 
- Kafan readiness:
  - Prefer while color. Cloth should medium; not very cheap; nor very expensive.
  - Self readiness is good. Prepare kafan for yourself. But do not prepare grave (??? may be due to: we dont know where we will die)
  - Cloth previously soaked with zamzam is okay (some people say its preferred)
  - Do not put anything inside or write kafan (ayat, dua etc.)
  - Do not use kaaba cloth as kafan, if cloth portion has ayats. But rest can be used as kurta or can be sewn in kurta. 
- By Age:
  - Young adults have same kafan as adults
  - Babies or young kids can have fewer cloth: one cloth (boy) and two cloths (girl)
- After wrapping in kafan, it is important to hide person face if its woman, but not for men. That cover sheet is not part of kafan. 



**Types of Kafan**

1. Sunnat (kafan-sunnata) - recommended
2. Sufficient (kafan-kifayat) - minimally required
3. Needed (kafan zaroorata) - in case if no choice; anything that can cover the satar (parts to hide)

5. Flip kurta top portion, so it fits around the neck and flows downwards
6. Remove thick cloth that was placed on satar during qusl

#### Manners of janazah:

- Walk fast, but not that fast that body is moved
- Walk on foot (mustahib = preferrable). 
- Preferance is to walk behind janazah, but some can walk in front (but not everyone). Do not walk on the side.

- DO NOT **loudly** recite kalma or dua while walking. (biddat). 
  - Okay to do in heart ?????
- Do not sit down in the middle, if there is no resonable excuse
- Folks who are watching janazah from the side, they should not stand for janazah. 



### Namaz e Janazah

- It is farz-e-kifaya (if no one goes there; then all who knew about it will be sinners). Even one person is sufficient (jamaat not required)

- Folks who didnt know about the death; it is not wrong if they skip it.

- **Timing**: No set timing for it, except **avoid**: sunrise, sunpeak, sunset, if janazah is preplanned. But if its sudden, then even those timings are okay

- **Conditions for person praying:** (All same conditions as regular namaz) + some conditions
  - Additional condition: the praying person must be aware of the death
  - Tayammum: (to read about if regular prayer time is ending ??? tayammum not allowed ??)
    - Wali (closet person) of janazah must do wudu (cannot do just tayammum). They can do another namaz e janazah later.
    - Non-wali of janazah can do tayammum, if there is risk of missing namaz e janazah

     1. person who died doing treason fight
     2. person who died during robbery 
     3. person who died while inciting violence
     4. person who killed parents
     5. **Note:** If above exception folks are caught, and then killed or die on their own, then namaz-e-janazah is required (except for person who killed parents)
     6. Namaz e janazah is okay to do for person who did suicide
  2. Body must be clean of nijazat haqiqi and hukmia (both) - (see [link](06-Nijasatain.md))
     1. If body has nijasat leaking after qusl, then its okay to do namaz

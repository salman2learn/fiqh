1. When tayamum breaks:
   1. Everything that breaks wudu
      1. Liquid flow from body e.g. blood, 
         1. Scratch (no blood flow) does not break wudu
      2. Laughing during namaz
      3. Talking to another human during namaz:
         1. Saying AlHamdolillah during namaz does NOT break (saying to self)
         2. Saying Yarhamukullah during namaz DOES break wudu (saying to other human)
      4. Sleeping breaks wudu
      5. Slight sleepy (oong) during namaz
         1. Standing (no leaning) does not break wudu
         2. Sleeping in Sajda (male; no leaning) does not break wudu
         3. Sleeping in Sajda (female; leaning on ground) breaks wudu
   2. If water becomes available
   3. Person was not touching water due to illness .. 
      1. tayamum is okay, but tayamum breaks as soon as illness is gone.
2. Difference b/w **tayamum of wudu** and **tayamum of ghusul**
   1. None
3. Tayamum niyat is compulsary
   1. Yes. And the intent can be any: e.g. touching quran, doing azaan, doing namaz, doing
   2. Only tayamum valid for that intent.
4. Material which burns or melts or decomposes in sand is NOT allowed for tayamum.

   3. Not OK to do tayamum: wooden furniture, glass, carpet, cloth, coal, book, plastic
5. Tayamum of Namaz > covers > Tilawat
   1. But vice versa is not valid

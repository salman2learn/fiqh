### Types of Roza

| Types                                  | Descr                                                        | Notes                                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Farz                                   | Ramzan fasting, if all requirements are met                  |                                                              |
| Wajib                                  | 1. To compensate breaking of nafil roza. <br />2. Nazar roza (self-created promise to Allah to do roza)<br />3. Kaffara roza | Two types of Nazar roza: constrainted by day/date/time versus unconstrained. See below graph. |
| Masnoon (preferred by Prophet)         | Muharram 9, 10 and 11                                        | 10th is a sacred day for Muslim for many reasons.<br />10th is jewish fasting day for their freedom from pharos. <br />Our prophet said Prophet Musa was closer to us too. So we prefer to fast too. <br />There are also other reasons for fasting.<br />Hazrat Hussain's rank became higher as his shadat was also on this sacred day. |
| Mustahib (mundoob) - (for extra sawab) | 1. 3 rozas per months on any days<br />2. Near full moon days (13, 14, 15)<br />3. Mon, Thu every week<br />4. Six (6) days of Shawwaal<br />5. 9th Zil-hij (for non-haji)<br />6. Alternate days (Saum -e- Daudi) ??? | #2. ayam-e-beiz (beiz = white)<br />#4. 6 days after ramzan (hadis: 30 ramdan +6 shawal is like full year of fasting)<br />#5. one day before eid-ul-azha<br />#6. a habit of Hazrat Daud A.S. |
| Makrooh                                | 1. Only Muharram 9th (not fasting on 10th and 11th)<br />2. Only fasting on Saturday ???<br />3. Continuous fasting, e.g. roza on next day without iftar of previous day (saum -e- wisal) | #2. Torayt and Zaboor was for jewish. They had Sat as the holy day. (just like Muslims=Friday, and Christians=Sunday). <br />Adding another day make us distinct from others. |
| Haram                                  | 1. Both Eid days<br />2. Zil-hij 11,12,13 (ayam-e-tashriq ???) | #2. Haj is on Zih-hij 9-13.                                  |

Zihar:  A condemned act. When a man says divorce-like comment (but not divorce) to wife; e.g. "to me, you are like my mother". Husband must compensate before contacting again. Compensation is 2 months successive fasting or feeding sixty people (i think for a day) or freeing a slave. In pre-islamic days, it was equivalent to divorce. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zihar

### Conditions of roza validity:

1. Doing niyat (more details later)

2. Not eating, drinking or spousal.

3. Women not having periods the whole day.

| <u>**Jawf**</u>   | <u>Organs</u>                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Descr             | Human organs e.g. stomach, intestines, lungs, brain, etc.<br />Jawf means hollow cavity in a human organ. |
| Relevance to Roza | If anything from outside reaches these relevant organs, roza is void.<br />1. Stomach<br />2. Throat (including lungs e.g. if tobacco smoke reaches lungs)<br />3. Intestines<br />4. Brain (not brain itself, but nose pipe and its connectivity to throat) |
|                   |                                                              |
| <u>**Manfaz**</u> | <u>**Comes from word: nafooz = pathway or route**</u>        |
| Descr             | Pathways in human body which touch Jawf, whether natural (by birth) or created later (e.g. due to some injury).<br />Natural: e.g. nose, mouth, ears, excretion area<br />Unnatural: e.g. due to deep injury that reaches to jawf. |
| Relevance to Roza | Hanafi: if anything reaches, through these any route (natural or unnatural), then fast is void.<br />Sahibeen: Fast is void only if anything reaches via natural routes |
|                   |                                                              |
| <u>**Masam**</u>  | <u>**Pores on skin**</u>                                     |
| Descr             | e.g. pores used for perspiration                             |
| Relevance to Roza | If any external thing reaches to jawf organs via these pores, the fast stays. e.g. applying oil or cream or medicine on skin, injection/drip on skin or blood vein (???)<br />Although eye is a route, but it is considered as a pores. Therefore, rosewater or surma does not break fast. |
